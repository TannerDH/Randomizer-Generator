# Randomizer-Generator
A personal project for making a random generator to help me make decision on stupid things.
First major part is to make a nice looking generator that spitls out a Pokemon name and type.

Goals:
1. have a button that outputs a Pokemon name and type after pressed. check
2. some how reduce the pokemon list of megas and unnecessary forms but not removing regional variants
3. output the pokemon's image when the button is pressed with the name and type of the pokemon
4. make options for the generator (generating a pokemon by type or what gen they are from)
5. pretty-fy the generator
6. update as needed?

Hopefully I can update this README file as the times go on. Thanks.
